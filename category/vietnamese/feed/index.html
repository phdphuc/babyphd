								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new variant of adware was just discovered yesterday. It’s going viral on Twitter and other media, since they use valid Apple developer certificate to sign all packed samples. I’m quite overbusy these days but it got my interest when seeing the name stated in that certificate: “Quoc Thinh”, quite a unique Vietnamese name. So why not take a break from desperate thesis, toss adware in my lame automated MacOS analysis framework and see what our ‘countryman’ doing?</p>
<p><span id="more-687"></span>The sample was first noticed by <em>Gavriel State</em>‏ on Aug 7, then <em>Thomas A Reed</em> – the Mac malware boss hunter from Malwarebytes - confirmed it relates to OperatorMac on the next day. I think you all know the famous Mac free security tools’ author: <em>Patrick Wardle</em>, wrote an amazing report on <a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x20.html">objective-see.com</a> in Aug 9. So I’m not going too deep in reverse engineering - static analysis, just throw in my Grey-cuckoo framework and grab results. In case somebody doesn’t know, it’s my thesis project and and soon to be released right after my judgment day - defense (hopefully).</p>
<p>From Patrick’s report we understand it’s an adware which installs lots of crabs. By default, cuckoo sandbox timeout is 120 sec. Let’s extend it a bit, 300 sec (5 min) would be enough.</p>

<p>First result we got, that Apple developer ID “Quoc Thinh”, and he got his certificate revoked from Apple today by the way <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f604.png" alt="😄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />.</p>
<p><code>spctl -avv "Mughthesec-Player(dmg).dmg"<br />
Mughthesec-Player(dmg).dmg: <strong>CSSMERR_TP_CERT_REVOKED</strong></code></p>
<p>From captured screenshots, we can see what this adware apparently executes: Install Adobe flash and offer you a bunch of PUA (potential unwanted applications) – Booking, Advanced Mac Cleaner, SafeFinder Safari extension, and AdBlock (in some relevant samples that will be discussed later).</p>

<p>Behavioral analysis shows the packed DMG sample invoked a ‘mac’ binary, thereafter ‘Mughthesec’ with a persistence ‘I’ binary. Screenshots below already included other analysis variant of this campaign.</p>

<p>Move on to the network DNS feature, we see a lot of queries and some domains look "suspicious". Their DNS servers mostly are pointed to Akamai so I suggest we rather use domain as IOC than IP address, which could be different from viewers location. Filtering system calls logs with some rules of mine, there is no evasion technique been found. It’s quite surprising because Virustotal behavioral analysis shows a shorter execution trace than mine, which usually means its environment was detected at some point and malware stop running. In Patrick’s report he said there might be MAC address verification to detect VM (VM MAC usually starts with ’00:xx’). Fortunately, my VM framework MAC address was modified long ago since my colleague Yorick Koster at Securify used same trick to abuse my lame framework (thanks Yorick). I should add new rule – “MAC address check” later.</p>

<p>Additionally instead of execve(), MacOS sandbox policy usually invokes processes using XPCProxy or launchd services. So we got several processes created with posix_spawn(): delete Safari, iBooks, Mail cache (likely Advanced Mac cleaner doing its job), install mentioned PUAs and we got some new IOCs.</p>

<p>Other great things from Cuckoo sandbox are Network analysis and Dropped files. However previous report detailed it well enough, hence only some screenshots from these features will be showed:</p>

<p>Some dropped binaries like AMCleaner (93dd0c34a4ec25a508cd6d5fb86d8ccc0c318238d9fee0c93342a20759bf9b7e) already marked as malicious on VirusTotal (VT) 7/56, which could be an indication for vigilant users.</p>
<p>Also with some fancy nonsense statistic screenshots, intent to scare analyst (:p)</p>

<p>At this moment, we have got all indicators to make behavioral detection rule and go hunting for other similar adware samples. Reason why I call this blog post – “a campaign”: there are numerous similar packed DMG/Mac apps matched ‘my behavioral rule’: fake Adobe Flash installer, lots of PUAs from subdomain name [cdn, dl, api] and Vietnamese developer certificate ID.</p>

<p>Please note that VT score is an indicator only, people usually fail to judge hardworking AVs by looking at VT score. We can never know if AV would detect those adwares live running whether or not. Also instead of Mughthesec, other adware use different loader names such as SearchWebSvc, TrustedSafeFinder, etc. I don’t think OSX/Mughthesec would be appropriate for the adware name. I suggest it would be OperatorMac because all campaign packages call a simple loader “mac” binary.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Be <strong>vigilant</strong>, no one needs Flash nowadays it’s dead. Apple Mac is not virus-free even with those fancy Apple protection XProtect, GateKeeper, Mac sandbox, code signing, etc, many security researchers already warned.</p>
<p>It’s likely an affiliation advertising campaign, in which adware authors spent quite some money (~$800) for these 8 Apple developer certificates and only 2 of them are revoked. Some of dropped MachO executables are not signed, and we don’t know what if those can be really dangerous (like the unsigned MachO executable from APT32 Ocean Lotus campaign targeted Vietnamese organizations lately is really a sophisticated one). Based on timeline and periods of certificate registration, and money they have spent, I doubt these adware creators are making lots of money. Last, let me remind you some incidents happened recently and could be related to this campaign:</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Multi-Party Computation (MPC)</strong> là một khái niệm được các nhà mật mã học đắn đo nghiên cứu tận những thập niên 80 thế kỷ trước. Xuất phát tự nhiên từ những bài toán học búa trong cuộc sống phải đặt ra một giao thức hay ho hơn để đánh đố nhau. Ví dụ năm 1982 đó là bài toán triệu phú của anh Yao (1982 <a title="Andrew Yao" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Yao">Andrew Yao</a>  1), diễn Nôm đơn giản là anh Bin có số A tiền, còn anh Job có số B tiền. Hai anh trong một cuộc nhậu lỡ thách nhau xem ai có nhiều tiền hơn ai <a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="568" data-permalink="https://babyphd.net/2016/09/07/an-toan-tinh-toan-da-thanh-vien/surrender/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="128,128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="surrender" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-568" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?resize=25%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="surrender" width="25" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>. Nhưng hai anh đều không muốn lộ ra tổng số tiền mình có cho nhau biết. Do đó mới nảy sinh bài toàn chứng minh bất đẳng thức A ≥ B mà không lộ thông tin nào của A và B cho bất cứ ai, kể cả 2 anh Bin và anh Jobs. Giải quyết xong bài toàn này đã mở ra một kỷ nguyên mới cho bảo mật thông tin đặc biệt là thương mai điện tử, data mining khi muốn so sánh các giá trị, tính toán cộng trừ nhân chia mà vẫn bảo vệ được thông tin mật như số tiền, tổng tiền trong tài khoản khách hàng, thông tin nhân khẩu học v.v.</p>

<p>Ví dụ thứ hai đó là trò chơi tình yêu, như các bạn đọc biết <a href="http://ctf.yeuchimse.com">yeuchimse</a> là một thanh niên ủy mị ướt át, sến rện hay nghĩ lung tung. Sẻ đệ lần đầu tiên không dám tỏ tình vì sợ người ấy không thích mình thì thật là quê độ nên đã yêu cầu <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009514863101">chuymichxinhdep </a>thiết kế một giao thức sao cho:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Eligibility</strong>: được thổ lộ và chỉ thổ lộ môt lần.</li>
<li><strong>Privacy</strong>: đảm bảo không lộ thông tin đã thổ lộ cho bất kỳ ai biết, cho dù đó là người ấy hay chính <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009514863101">chuymichxinhdep </a></li>
<li><strong>Universal Verifiability</strong>: ai cũng có thể check được kết quả là 2 đứa nó có đến được với nhau hay không để đảm bảo tính công bằng của cuộc chơi tình ái.</li>
<li><strong>Robustness</strong>: Mọi hành động gian trá ví dụ như thổ lộ có yêu sau đó lại thay đổi ý kiến là không yêu đều bị cấm.</li>

<p>Với 5 lá bài Át, mặc định một chiếc lá Át cơ đỏ đặt sẵn trên bàn. Với các câu trả lời giữa 2 người tham gia trò chơi là Yêu hoặc không Yêu tương ứng với 2 cách xếp bài Át cơ, Át bích. Sau khi đặt bài xuống bàn (có thể thay đổi chiều hàng 5 bài để không ai biết câu trả lời của mình ở bên nào) thì kết quả cả 2 người đều có cảm tình với nhau chỉ xảy ra khi có 3 quân Át cơ nằm cạnh nhau. Trường hợp kết quả 2 người không hợp nhau thì vẫn đảm bảo cô gái không biết được đối phương trả lời là Yêu hay không Yêu. (Thật là vi diệu phải không? <a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-565" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?resize=25%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="boss" width="25" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>)</p>

<p><strong>2. OT</strong></p>
<p>Để hóc búa hơn, người ta đã phát minh ra giao thức rất hay ho đó là Chuyển giao không lộ thông tin ( Oblivious Transfer ) đơn giản thế này:  Anh Mao giữ 2 giá trị <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i1.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_9865b118af4cfc107929ec116ab9eb80.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> là bít tức là chỉ có 0 hoặc 1, chị MaiAnh giữ một giá trị secret s, tất nhiên, cũng chỉ là bít 01. Chị chọn một số u ngẫu nhiên khá to trong tập nguyên <strong>Z</strong> và chị tính <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_7cb433fd43ea022f61fa76e4d73a28d8.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> với <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_7997a21e02329ca6c6bc77e68e43277e.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>. Do <em>s</em> là bit nên lúc này chị có 2 giá trị <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i1.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_f6bf330e68e6b2523ee18338347b8e2a.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>, chị gửi cả 2 giá trị này lại cho Mao với mục đích làm Mao không biết giá trị <em>u, s</em> là gì, kể cả giá trị <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_b2f5ff47436671b6e533d8dc3614845d.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> ở đây là generator chung mà cả 2 đều biết, thì theo bạn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption">ElGamal </a>đối với máy tính cổ lỗ của Mao là con MBP 15 inch đời giữa 2015, tới lúc bốc mộ cũng không giải ra được <em>u</em> (à mà với điều kiện là chị MaiAnh có <em>u</em> rất to nhé). Sau bước này thì Mao chọn 2 giá trị <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_53dd2b7a99cd54e0d6febbc311e5b554.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> cũng ngẫu nhiên trong tập nguyên để tính một phương trình phức tạp hơn đó là:</p>

<p>Rồi Mao chuyển lại cặp <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_dbdce35eb2f44b7d782b3408c9661212.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> để cho MaiAnh tính ra <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_d9094fb8cc52a45fb6338a51d0b15d53.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; ' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>. Như vậy, Mao không để lộ cả 2 giá trị <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i1.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_9865b118af4cfc107929ec116ab9eb80.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span>, trong khi MaiAnh không để lộ <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i1.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_03c7c0ace395d80182db07ae2c30f034.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:2px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> mà vẫn lấy được <span class='MathJax_Preview'><img src='https://i1.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/plugins/latex/cache/tex_a727b3abb09c0ecf8898343a5bbeffb1.gif?w=604&#038;ssl=1' style='vertical-align: middle; border: none; padding-bottom:1px;' class='tex' alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span> về. Mao cũng không biết được MaiAnh đã lấy số nào về mà chỉ biết MaiAnh đã lấy được 1 số. Tóm tắt lại trong hình như sau:</p>

<p>Câu hỏi đặt ra OT sẽ được áp dụng như thế nào, ví dụ anh Mích đang làm hệ thống e-Health sức khỏe y tế điện tử. Vì anh là bên thứ 3 làm tin học nên tất nhiên anh không được ông quan thanh liêm nào cho tiếp cận vào hồ sơ y tế của bệnh nhân. Do đó anh quyết định ký hợp đồng với bệnh viện sử dụng OT để làm API truy cập thông tin. Lúc này anh làm demo nên cơ sở dữ liệu mới có thông tin HIV của 2 bệnh nhân lưu dưới dạng dương tính (1) và âm tính (0). Áp dụng OTP anh Mích đã có thể biết trạng thái HIV của 1 trong 2 bệnh nhân mà bệnh viên không biết anh đã query bệnh nhân nào.</p>
<p><strong>3.ZKP</strong></p>
<p>Bệnh cạnh việc dùng OT để chia sẻ không lộ thông tin, người ta còn nghĩ ra nhiều trò phức tạp khác dưới cái tên <strong>ZKP (Zero Knowledge Proof)</strong> điển hình là bài toán lên bar của chụy Mích được trình bày như sau: Trong một lần trên bar hơi muộn vào khoảng 2 giờ sáng thì các anh pokemon ập vào đòi kiểm tra hành chính với lý do trên 18 tuổi mới được ngồi bar hút thuốc bú diệu như một số hoa hậu nào đó. Vốn là một người tôn trọng quyền con người chụy không muốn ai phán xét vì hút thuốc lá là quyền tự do của mỗi người. Chụy chân thành chúc mừng bạn chụy nếu em bỏ được thuốc, còn không em cũng đừng buồn vì sau một thời gian nghỉ, điếu thuốc sắp tới em hút đảm bảo nó sẽ ngon không bút nào tả xiết. Ngoài ra lại vốn là một người tôn trọng quyền con người chụy cũng không muốn để lộ liễu ngày sinh nhật của mình giữa chốn đông người. Thay vì trình ID CMND hay bằng lái chụy đã show thẻ ngân hàng của mình để quẹt bill cho các anh xem. Với luật trên 18 tuổi mới được làm credit card nên mặc nhiên chụy đã chứng minh mình đã trên 18 tuổi mà không để lộ ngày sinh của mình <a href="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="566" data-permalink="https://babyphd.net/2016/09/07/an-toan-tinh-toan-da-thanh-vien/sexy_girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="128,128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sexy_girl" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-566" src="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?resize=25%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="sexy_girl" width="25" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>.</p>
<p>Một ví dụ ZKP thứ 2 đó là ví dụ hang động của AliBaBa:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-3.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="567" data-permalink="https://babyphd.net/2016/09/07/an-toan-tinh-toan-da-thanh-vien/untitled-4/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-3.png?fit=277%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="277,187" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Untitled" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-3.png?fit=277%2C187&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-3.png?fit=277%2C187&amp;ssl=1" class="size-full wp-image-567 aligncenter" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-3.png?resize=277%2C187&#038;ssl=1" alt="Untitled" width="277" height="187" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>
<p>Nhi tuyên bố rằng cô biết mật mã để mở cửa hang. Líp hỏi cô phải chứng minh tuyên bố của mình. Nhưng Nhi không thể nói mật khẩu cho Líp vì như vậy thật là lộ liễu <a href="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="566" data-permalink="https://babyphd.net/2016/09/07/an-toan-tinh-toan-da-thanh-vien/sexy_girl/" data-orig-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="128,128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="sexy_girl" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-566" src="https://i2.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/sexy_girl.png?resize=25%2C25&#038;ssl=1" alt="sexy_girl" width="25" height="25" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>. Do đó chụy Mích đã chỉ cho Nhi một cách như sau:</p>
<ul>
<li>Líp đứng quay mặt tụt quần ở một khoảng cách khá xa và chờ Nhi bước vào hang.<br />
Sau đó, Líp đến cửa hang rõ ràng anh ta không biết Nhi đã đi sang bên nào.</li>
<li>Líp tùy ý hét lên yêu cầu Nhi bước ra từ bên trái hoặc bên phải.</li>
<li>Hai đứa lặp lại trò chơi này cho đến khi Líp bị thuyết phục hoặc Nhi chán không chơi nữa.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rõ ràng nếu Nhi đã ở phía bên trái và Líp yêu cầu cô ấy đến từ bên trái thì quả này Nhi đã may mắn <a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-568" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?resize=24%2C24&#038;ssl=1" alt="surrender" width="24" height="24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>. Nếu không, Nhi chỉ có thể đến từ bên trái nếu cô ấy biết mật mã để mở cửa hang phải không nào (!?).</p>
<p><strong>4.Hệ mật đồng cấu( Homomorphic cryptosystem)</strong></p>
<p>Để tiếp tục là cuộc chơi thêm phần phức tạp, các nhà mật mã học lại tiếp tục nghĩ ra Hệ mật đồng cấu được định nghĩa:</p>

<p>Hệ mã hoá Elgamal có tính chất đồng cấu, nhờ nó có thể tính được kết quả trong cuộc bỏ phiếu “chọn một trong hai”, mà không cần giải mã từng lá phiếu. Sơ đồ chia sẻ bí mật Shamir phối hợp với hệ mã hoá Elgamal còn có tính chất đặc biệt hơn nữa, nhờ nó có thể chia lá phiếu thành nhiều mảnh, cử tri gửi mỗi mảnh cho một thành viên ban kiểm phiếu, khi khớp các mảnh phiếu lại sẽ được nội dung đầy đủ của lá phiếu. Bài báo này trình bày các tính chất trên và chỉ ra ứng dụng của chúng trong bỏ phiếu từ xa.Hệ mã hoá Elgamal có tính chất đồng cấu, nhờ nó có thể tính được kết quả trong cuộc bỏ phiếu “chọn một trong hai”, mà không cần giải mã từng lá phiếu.

<p class="">Vậy tại sao có RSA phổ cập nông thôn đã chất chơi người dơi rồi, các nhà mật mã học lại phải nghĩ ra hệ mật oái ăm này <a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?ssl=1"><img class="alignnone wp-image-568" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/surrender.png?resize=24%2C24&#038;ssl=1" alt="surrender" width="24" height="24" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a>. Ấy là vì ở đây ta có random r, mỗi lần mã hóa lại có ciphertext khác nhau. Ngoài ra với mỗi ciphertext nếu không biết random r thì lại ra vô số message m thỏa khác nhau. Ngoài ra với tính chất đồng cấu giúp cho phép cộng (+) và lũy thừa (^) ta có thể thiết kế các giao thức mã hóa gửi đi ciphertext để một bên thứ ba tính toán, bên tính toán này chỉ trả về kết quả phép tính mà không biết giá trị mà bên cần tính đưa ra là gì <a href="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?ssl=1"><img data-attachment-id="565" data-permalink="https://babyphd.net/2016/09/07/an-toan-tinh-toan-da-thanh-vien/boss/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="128,128" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="boss" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?fit=128%2C128&amp;ssl=1" class="alignnone wp-image-565" src="https://i0.wp.com/babyphd.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/boss.png?resize=27%2C27&#038;ssl=1" alt="boss" width="27" height="27" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p class="">Đầu tiên, giả sử tôi có một hệ cơ sở dữ liệu cần mã hóa Paillier với 3 cột: Tên, tuổi, thu nhập. Tôi xin ăn cắp thư viện Pure Python Paillier Homomorphic Cryptosystem (3) để mã hóa dưới đây:</p>
<pre class="lang:python decode:true">from paillier.paillier import *
from timer import Timer
import random,string

def encrypt_db():
	print "Encrypting...."
	for p in session.query(Person):
		p.age = str(encrypt(pub, int(p.age)))
		p.income = str(encrypt(pub, int(p.income)))
		p.name = str(int(p.name.encode("hex"),16))
	session.commit()

def decrypt_db():
	print "Decrypting...."
	for p in session.query(Person):
		print decrypt(priv, pub, int(p.age)) ,decrypt(priv, pub, int(p.income)) , hex(decrypt(priv, pub, int(p.name ))).replace("0x","").replace("L","")

print "Generating keypair..."
priv, pub =  generate_keypair(2048)
</pre>
<p>Với quyền query lên database toàn bộ bị mã hóa, tôi có 2 bài toán cần giải quyết đó là:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nhập lên một số <em>x</em>, yêu cầu trả lời câu hỏi có bao nhiêu người có độ tuổi lớn hơn x mà không làm lộ số <em>x</em> đang được hỏi.</li>
<li>Tính tổng thu nhập của tất cả những người có độ tuổi lớn hơn x mà không làm lộ thông tin thu nhập của từng người.</li>
</ul>
<p>Đề giải quyết 2 bài toán trên, tôi tham khảo giao thức tính toán không làm lộ dữ liệu được cải tiến của Zerkin (4) bạn tôi như sau:</p>

<p>Vậy với bài toán 1, để biết bao người có số tuổi từ x đổ lên ta chỉ cần query bằng hàm A():</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">index = [-1]*len(income)	
for i in range(len(age)):
	enc_x = encrypt(pub, x)
	if int(A(pub, age[i],  enc_x))&gt;0:
		index[number] = i
		number+=1</pre>
<p>Với bài toán 2, để thêm phần bảo mật ta nhét thêm một số random r thật dài vào mỗi lần query như sau:</p>
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">	r = random.randrange(2**(80+32))
	for i in index:
		if i&gt;-1:
			totalincome = e_add(pub, totalincome, income[i])
	totalincome = e_add(pub, totalincome, encrypt(pub,r))
	totalincome = decrypt(priv,pub,totalincome) - r</pre>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Programming 300 - grids</strong></p>
<p>Đề bài nhận được là cho 1 tập hợp điểm trên mặt phẳng 2D, cần tìm diện tích đa giác lớn nhất tạo được mà các đỉnh của đa giác được lấy từ tập hợp điểm đã cho. Dễ thấy là đa giác cần tìm cần bao trọn toàn bộ tập điểm, nên bài toán quy về việc tính diện tích <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull">bao lồi</a> của tập điểm này.</p>
<p>Có thể dùng <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_scan">thuật toán quét Graham</a> để tìm bao lồi sau đó dùng <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula">công thức tính diện tích của Gauss</a> để tính diện tích đa giác vừa tìm được. Nhưng trong SciPy đã có <a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-dev/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.ConvexHull.html">code tìm bao lồi</a> nên mình không cần phải code lại phần bao lồi nữa :))</p>

File trong đề là 1 file .sav của VirtualBox nhận được khi tạo snapshot hoặc suspend máy ảo. File chỉ chứa một phần RAM đã được sử dụng và được sắp xếp theo một trật tự không nhất định nên (theo quá trình Google của mình) không thể lấy trực tiếp thông tin trên đây được :&lt;, mà cần phải chạy file .sav trên VirtualBox rồi tạo core dump hoặc memdump sau đấy mới phân tích được.</p>
<p>Mình đã tạo một máy ảo VirtualBox với hệ điều hành là Ubuntu x64, để ổ cứng kết nối ở IDE Primary Master, card mạng là Am79C973, RAM là 128MB. Sau đó mình boot máy ảo này, suspend nó, rồi ghi đè file đã cho vào file .sav được VirtualBox tạo ra. Sau đó khi khởi động lại, mình vào được trạng thái đang lưu trong file .sav với hệ điều hành là Tiny Core Linux:</p>

<p>Ở trong lịch sử dòng lệnh, có một lệnh là </p>
<pre>python -c "$(curl -fSsL http://a.asis.io/0QnqZU9F)"</pre>
<p>Lệnh này down 1 file .py từ server và thực hiện file này. Mình đã không quan tâm đến nó trong khi đây chính là mấu chốt của bài toán :&lt; (cảm ơn anh @yeuchimse đã chỉ cho em đoạn này :3).</p>
<p>Như vậy có khả năng file Python kia vẫn còn được lưu đâu đó ở trong RAM của máy ảo, vì vậy cần phải đọc được RAM và tìm kiếm đoạn &#039;Please enter the access key&#039; vì khi chương trình được chạy có in ra dòng này. Trong quá trình thi, mình đã chạy VirtualBox trong một máy ảo VMware và dump RAM của máy ảo VMware để tìm trong đó :&lt;. Tuy vậy có một cách đơn giản hơn là dùng HxD hoặc Cheat Engine. Sau khi tìm kiếm với chuỗi: </p>

<p>Đoạn code này yêu cầu nhập 1 chuỗi là key, và nếu key đúng sẽ in ra thứ gì đó. Thử xây dựng lại key từ file code tìm được, sau đó dùng key này để tìm chuỗi in ra:</p>
